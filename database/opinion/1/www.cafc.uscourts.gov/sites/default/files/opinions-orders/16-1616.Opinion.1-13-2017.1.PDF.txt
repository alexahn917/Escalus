Before NEWMAN, O’MALLEY, and WALLACH, Circuit 

Judges. 

NEWMAN, Circuit Judge. 

The CQG companies appeal the decision of the United 
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, 
holding  that  the  asserted  claims  of  U.S.  Patents  No. 
6,772,132 (“the ’132 patent”) and No. 6,766,304 (“the ’304 
patent”)  recite  patent-eligible  subject  matter  in  terms  of 
35  U.S.C.  § 101.    This  appeal  relates  only  to  eligibility 
under Section 101.  We affirm the district court’s decision. 

DISCUSSION 

Patent  owner  Trading  Technologies  International, 
Inc.  (“TTI”)  charged  CQG  with  infringement  of  the  ’132 
patent and the ’304 patent.  CGQ moved for judgment as 
a matter of law, asserting that the claims of these patents 
are  directed  to  patent-ineligible  subject  matter.    The 
district  court  denied  CGQ’s  motion,  holding  that  the 
claims are not directed to an abstract idea and also that 
they  recite  an  inventive  concept,  such  that  the  subject 
matter  is  patent-eligible  under  § 101.    Trading  Techs.

Int’l, Inc. v. CQG, Inc., No. 05-cv-4811, 2015 WL 774655 
(N.D.  Ill.  Feb.  24,  2015)  (“Dist.  Ct.  op.”).    CGQ  appeals 
this holding. 

The ’132 and ’304 patents describe and claim a meth-
od and system for the electronic trading of stocks, bonds, 
futures,  options  and  similar  products.    The  patents  ex-
plain problems that arise when a trader attempts to enter 
an  order  at  a  particular  price,  but  misses  the  price  be-
cause the market moved before the order was entered and 
executed.    It  also  sometimes  occurred  that  trades  were 
executed  at  different  prices  than  intended,  due  to  rapid 
market  movement.    This  is  the  problem  to  which  these 
patents are directed. 

The patents are for “[a] method and system for reduc-
ing  the  time  it  takes  for  a  trader  to  place  a  trade  when 
electronically trading on an exchange, thus increasing the 
likelihood that the trader will have orders filled at desira-
ble  prices  and  quantities.”    ’132  patent,  Abstract;  ’304 
patent, Abstract.  The patents describe a trading system 
in which a graphical user interface “display[s] the market 
depth  of  a  commodity  traded  in  a  market,[1]  including  a 
dynamic display for a plurality of bids and for a plurality 
of  asks  in  the  market  for  the  commodity  and  a  static 
display of prices corresponding to the plurality of bids and 
asks.”  ’132 patent col. 3, ll. 11–16; ’304 patent col. 3, ll. 
15–20.  In the patented system bid and asked prices are 
displayed  dynamically  along  the  static  display,  and  the 
system pairs orders with the static display of prices and 
prevents order entry at a changed price. 

Both  the  ’132  and  the  ’304  patents  have  the  same 
specification, and the district court treated claim 1 in each

“A  commodity’s  market  depth  is  the  current  bid 
and ask prices and quantities in the market.”  ’132 patent 
col. 3, ll. 69–61; ’304 patent col. 3, ll. 63–65.

patent  as  representative,  as  agreed  by  the  parties.    We 
illustrate  the  analysis  of  §  101  with  respect  to  method 
Claim 1 of the ’304 patent: 

1. A method for displaying market information re-
lating  to  and  facilitating  trading  of  a  commodity 
being traded in an electronic exchange having an 
inside market with a highest bid price and a low-
est  ask  price  on  a  graphical  user  interface,  the 
method comprising; 
dynamically displaying a first indicator in one of a 
plurality of locations in a bid display region, each 
location in the bid display region corresponding to 
a price level along a common static price axis, the 
first  indicator  representing  quantity  associated 
with  at  least  one  order  to  buy  the  commodity  at 
the  highest  bid  price  currently  available  in  the 
market; 
dynamically  displaying  a  second  indicator  in  one 
of a plurality of locations in an ask display region, 
each location in the ask display region correspond-
ing to a price level along the common static price 
axis,  the  second  indicator  representing  quantity 
associated with at least one order to sell the com-
modity at the lowest ask price currently available 
in the market; 
displaying the bid and ask display regions in rela-
tion  to  fixed  price  levels  positioned  along  the 
common  static  price  axis  such  that  when  the  in-
side  market  changes,  the  price  levels  along  the 
common static price axis do not move and at least 
one of the first and second indicators moves in the 
bid or ask display regions relative to the common 
static price axis; 
displaying an order entry region comprising a plu-
rality of locations for receiving commands to send

5 

trade  orders,  each  location  corresponding  to  a 
price level along the common static price axis; and 
in response to a selection of a particular location 
of  the  order  entry  region  by  a  single  action  of  a 
user  input  device,  setting  a  plurality  of  parame-
ters  for  a  trade  order  relating  to  the  commodity 
and  sending  the  trade  order  to  the  electronic  ex-
change. 

’304 patent col. 12, l. 36–col. 13, l. 3.  The ’132 claims are 
directed to similar subject matter covering a method and 
system. 

The  Court’s  opinion  in  Alice  Corporation  Pty.  Ltd.  v. 
CLS Bank International, 134 S.Ct. 2347 (2014), provides 
the framework for patent-eligibility of business methods.  
The Court explained that a patent’s 

claim  falls  outside  § 101  where  (1)  it is  “directed 
to”  a  patent-ineligible  concept,  i.e.,  a  law  of  na-
ture,  natural  phenomenon,  or  abstract  idea,  and 
(2), if so, the particular elements of the claim, con-
sidered “both individually and ‘as an ordered com-
bination,’”  do  not  add  enough  to  “‘transform  the 
nature of the claim’ into a patent-eligible applica-
tion.” 

Id.  at  2355  (citations  omitted).    Patent  eligibility  under 
§ 101 is an issue of law, and receives de novo determina-
tion on appeal.2 

                                            
2   The  parties  dispute  whether  the  district  court 
erred  in  requiring  proof  of  ineligibility  under  §  101  by 
clear and convincing evidence.  Because our review is de 
novo,  and  because  under  either  standard  the  legal  re-
quirements  for  patentability  are  satisfied,  we  need  not 
address this dispute.

TRADING TECHS. INT’L, INC. v. CQG, INC. 

The district court first applied Step 1 of this two-step 
framework.  The court held that, rather than reciting “a 
mathematical  algorithm,”  “a  fundamental  economic  or 
longstanding  commercial  practice,”  or  “a  challenge  in 
business,” the challenged patents “solve problems of prior 
graphical  user  interface  devices . . . in  the  context  of 
computerized  trading[]  relating  to  speed,  accuracy  and 
usability.”    Dist.  Ct.  op.  at  *4  (citations  omitted).    The 
court  found  that  these  patents  are  directed  to  improve-
ments  in  existing  graphical  user  interface  devices  that 
have  no  “pre-electronic  trading  analog,”  and  recite  more 
than  “‘setting,  displaying,  and  selecting’  data  or  infor-
mation  that  is  visible  on  the  [graphical  user  interface] 
device.”  Id. 

The  district  court  explained  that  the  challenged  pa-
tents  do  not  simply  claim  displaying  information  on  a 
graphical  user  interface.    The  claims  require  a  specific, 
structured  graphical  user  interface  paired  with  a  pre-
scribed functionality directly related to the graphical user 
interface’s  structure  that  is  addressed  to  and  resolves  a 
specifically identified problem in the prior state of the art.  
The  district  court  concluded  that  the  patented  subject 
matter meets the eligibility standards of Alice Step 1.  We 
agree with this conclusion, for all of the reasons articulat-
ed by the district court, including that the graphical user 
interface system of these two patents is not an idea that 
has  long  existed,  the  threshold  criterion  of  an  abstract 
idea  and  ineligible  concept,  as  the  court  explained  in 
Mayo  Collaborative  Services  v.  Prometheus  Laboratories, 
Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 73 (2012) (the patent must “amount to 
significantly  more  in  practice  than  a  patent  upon  the 
[ineligible concept itself]”). 

The district court alternatively continued the analysis 
under  Alice  Step  2,  and  determined  that  the  challenged 
claims recite an “inventive concept.”  The court observed 
that Step 2 “requires something different than pre-AIA §§ 
102 and 103.”  Dist. Ct. op. at 8.  The court identified the 

TRADING TECHS. INT’L, INC. v. CQG, INC. 

7 

static  price  index  as  an  inventive  concept  that  allows 
traders  to  more  efficiently  and  accurately  place  trades 
using  this  electronic  trading  system.    The  court  distin-
guished this system from the routine or conventional use 
of  computers  or  the  Internet,  and  concluded  that  the 
specific  structure  and  concordant  functionality  of  the 
graphical user interface are removed from abstract ideas, 
as compared to conventional computer implementations of 
known procedures.  Thus the court held that the criteria 
of Alice Step 2 were also met. 

The  district  court’s  rulings  are  in  accord  with  prece-
dent.    Precedent  has  recognized  that  specific  technologic 
modifications to solve a problem or improve the function-
ing  of  a  known  system  generally  produce  patent-eligible 
subject  matter.    In  DDR  Holdings,  LLC  v.  Hotels.com, 
L.P., 773 F.3d 1245 (Fed. Cir. 2014), the court upheld the 
patent eligibility of claims “necessarily rooted in computer 
technology” that “overcome a problem specifically arising 
in the realm of computer networks.” Id. at 1257.  Similar-
ly, “claimed process[es] us[ing] a combined order of specif-
ic rules” that improved on existing technological processes 
were  deemed  patent-eligible  in  McRO,  Inc.  v.  Bandai 
Namco  Games  America  Inc.,  837  F.3d  1299,  1315  (Fed. 
Cir.  2016).    Claims  that  were  “directed  to  a  specific  im-
provement to the way computers operate, embodied in [a] 
self-referential  table,”  were  deemed  eligible  in  Enfish, 
LLC  v.  Microsoft  Corp.,  822  F.3d  1327,  1334  (Fed.  Cir. 
2016). 

Illustrating the operation of this principle to facts that 
negated patent eligibility, claims “drawn to the idea itself” 
of  “out-of-region  broadcasting  on  a  cellular  telephone,” 
without 
implementing  programmatic  structure,  were 
deemed  ineligible  in  Affinity  Labs  of  Tex.  v.  DIRECTV, 
LLC,  838  F.3d  1253,  1258  (Fed.  Cir.  2016).    Similarly, 
claims directed to the “idea of generating a second menu 
from a first menu and sending the second menu to anoth-
er  location”  were  held  patent-ineligible  in  Apple,  Inc.  v. 

8 

 

TRADING TECHS. INT’L, INC. v. CQG, INC. 

Ameranth,  Inc.,  842  F.3d  1229  (Fed.  Cir.  2016).    Claims 
directed to the “process of gathering and analyzing infor-
mation of a specified content, then displaying the results,” 
without  “any  particular  assertedly  inventive  technology 
for  performing  those  functions,”  were  held  ineligible  in 
Electric Power Grp.,  LLC v. Alstom S.A., 830 F.3d 1350, 
1354 (Fed. Cir. 2016).  As these cases illustrate, ineligible 
claims  generally  lack  steps  or  limitations  specific  to 
solution of a problem, or improvement in the functioning 
of technology. 

in 

computer 

technology 

For  some  computer-implemented  methods,  software 
may  be  essential  to  conduct  the  contemplated  improve-
ments.  Enfish, 822 F.3d at 1339 (“Much of the advance-
ment  made 
consists  of 
improvements to software that, by their very nature, may 
not be defined by particular physical features but rather 
by  logical  structures  and  processes.”).    Abstraction  is 
avoided or overcome when a proposed new application or 
computer-implemented function is not simply the general-
ized  use  of  a  computer  as  a  tool  to  conduct  a  known  or 
obvious  process,  but  instead  is  an  improvement  to  the 
capability of the system as a whole.  Id. at 1336. 

We  reiterate  the  Court’s  recognition  that  “at  some 
level, all inventions . . . embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or 
apply  laws  of  nature,  natural  phenomena,  or  abstract 
ideas.”  Alice, 134 S. Ct. at 2354, quoting Mayo 566 U.S. 
at 71.  This threshold level of eligibility is often usefully 
explored  by  way  of  the  substantive  statutory  criteria  of 
patentability,  for  an  invention  that  is  new,  useful  and 
unobvious is more readily distinguished from the general-
ized  knowledge  that  characterizes 
ineligible  subject 
matter.    This  analysis  is  facilitated  by  the  Court’s  guid-
ance  whereby  the  claims  are  viewed  in  accordance  with 
“the general rule that patent claims ‘must be considered 
as a whole’.”  Alice, 134 S. Ct. at 2355 n.3, quoting Dia-
mond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175, 188 (1981).

As  demonstrated  in  recent  jurisprudence  directed  to 
eligibility, and  as  illustrated  in  the  cases  cited  ante,  the 
claim elements are considered in combination for evalua-
tion under Alice Step 1, and then individually when Alice 
Step 2 is reached.  See BASCOM Global Internet Services 
v.  AT&T  Mobility  LLC,  827  F.3d  1341  (Fed.  Cir.  2016).  
Applying an overview of this evolving jurisprudence, the 
public interest in innovative advance is best served when 
close questions of eligibility are considered along with the 
understanding  flowing  from  review  of  the  patentability 
criteria  of  novelty,  unobviousness,  and  enablement,  for 
when  these  classical  criteria  are  evaluated,  the  issue  of 
subject  matter  eligibility  is  placed  in  the  context  of  the 
patent-based incentive to technologic progress. 

CONCLUSION 

It is  not  disputed  that  the  TTI  System improves  the 
accuracy  of  trader  transactions,  utilizing  a  software-
implemented programmatic met.  For Section 101 purpos-
es, precedent does not consider the substantive criteria of 
patentability.    For  Section  101  purposes,  the  claimed 
subject  matter  is  “directed  to  a  specific  improvement  to 
the way computers operate,” id., for the claimed graphical 
user interface method imparts a specific functionality to a 
trading system “directed to a specific implementation of a 
solution to a problem in the software arts.”  Id. at 1339. 

The district court’s analysis and conclusions conform 
to  precedent.    The  decision  that  the  subject  matter 
claimed in the ’132 and ’304 patents is patent-eligible in 
terms  of  Section  101  is  affirmed.    No  other  statutory 
criteria of patentability are before us on this appeal, and 
we state no opinion thereon.
