  MOSTELLER v. MSPB 

Ms.  Mosteller  appeals  a  final  decision  of  the  Merit 
Systems Protection Board, arguing that the Board incor-
rectly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction her appeal of the 
allegedly  improper  suspension  of  her  employment  with 
the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  The  Board 
correctly determined that Ms. Mosteller failed to make a 
non-frivolous allegation that she was suspended for more 
than fourteen days.  Therefore, we affirm.  

BACKGROUND 

Ms. Mosteller worked for the VA as a Program Ana-
lyst.  The VA suspended Ms. Mosteller for fourteen days, 
from  March  22  to  April  4,  2015.    Ms.  Mosteller  was  not 
allowed to return to work on her next scheduled work day.  
Instead,  on  April  6,  2015,  Ms.  Mosteller  received  notice 
from  the  VA  she  was  being  placed  on  “authorized  ab-
sence.”  On the same day, the VA provided Ms. Mosteller 
with  a  notice  of  proposed  removal.    Ms.  Mosteller  re-
mained  on  authorized  absence  until  the  VA  terminated 
her employment. 

Ms.  Mosteller  was  not  paid  during  her  fourteen-day 
suspension.  Initially, she was not paid during the period 
of authorized absence either.  Ms. Mosteller alleges that 
on May 15, 2015, she notified the agency that she was not 
being  paid.   It is  undisputed  that  on June  19, 2015,  the 
VA  retroactively  paid  Ms.  Mosteller  for  the  period  of 
authorized absence lasting from April 5 to May 22, 2015.   
Ms.  Mosteller  appealed her  removal  to  the  Board  on 
June 15, 2015.  In doing so, she filled out an intake form 
that asked her to indicate what kind of personnel action 
she was appealing.  She checked the box indicating that 
she was appealing her removal, but she did not check the 
box  indicating  that  she  was  appealing  any  suspension.  
S.A.  26.    The  June 15  intake  form  does  not  contain  any 
other  information  suggesting  that  she  was  appealing 
suspension.  S.A. 28.  On October 28, 2015—after the VA’s 
June  19  retroactive  payment—Ms.  Mosteller  filed  a 

MOSTELLER v. MSPB 

3 

prehearing submission alleging for the first time that the 
VA  constructively  suspended  her  for  more  than  thirty 
days  without  pay  prior  to  terminating  her  employment.  
S.A. 51.  

The  Administrative  Judge  (AJ)  docketed  a  separate 
appeal  to  address  her  suspension  claim.   A  third  appeal 
was docketed to address Ms. Mosteller’s claims of retalia-
tion  for  whistleblowing  and  for  protected  whistleblower 
activity.   

With  respect  to  the  suspension  claim,  the  AJ  issued 
an  order  to  show  cause  that  required  Ms.  Mosteller  to 
plead evidence sufficient to establish the Board’s jurisdic-
tion  over  her  claim.    In  her  submission,  Ms.  Mosteller 
apparently  alleged  that  she  was  only  suspended  for 
fourteen days.  Recognizing that the Board generally only 
has  jurisdiction  over  suspensions  without  pay  that  last 
longer than fourteen days, the AJ dismissed Ms. Mostel-
ler’s suspension claim for lack of jurisdiction.  In its order, 
the AJ also noted that Ms. Mosteller failed to refute the 
Agency’s  evidence  proving  that  it  retroactively  paid  her 
for the time on authorized absence.   

The  full  Board  affirmed  the  AJ’s  decision  that 
Ms. Mosteller failed to make a non-frivolous allegation of 
jurisdiction  over  a  suspension  for  more  than  fourteen 
days.  In doing so, the Board agreed with the AJ’s finding 
that Ms. Mosteller “failed to refute the agency’s evidence 
proving that she received retroactive pay.”  S.A. 14.   

DISCUSSION 

Whether the Board has jurisdiction over a particular 
appeal  is  a  question  of  law  that  this  court  reviews  de 
novo.  Bolton v. Merit. Sys. Prot. Bd., 154 F.3d 1313, 1316 
(Fed. Cir. 1998).  The petitioner bears the burden to show 
that  the  Board  has  jurisdiction  over  a  case.    Prewitt  v. 
Merit. Sys. Prot. Bd., 133 F.3d 885, 886 (Fed. Cir. 1998).  
If a petitioner makes a non-frivolous allegation of Board 

4 

 

  MOSTELLER v. MSPB 

jurisdiction,  she  is  entitled  to  a  hearing  on  the  jurisdic-
tional  question.    Garcia  v.  Dep’t  of  Homeland  Sec.,  437 
F.3d  1322,  1344  (Fed.  Cir.  2006)  (en  banc).    A  non-
frivolous  allegation  is  an  assertion  that,  if  proven,  could 
establish the matter at issue.  5 C.F.R. § 1201.4(s).   

The Board generally has jurisdiction to review an ap-
peal from a suspension of more than 14 days, not a sus-
pension  of  fourteen  days  or  less.    5  U.S.C.  §  7512.  
Suspension is defined as “the placing of an employee, for 
disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status without duties 
and pay.”  5 U.S.C. § 7501(2).   

The Board’s jurisdiction is determined by the nature 
of the agency’s action at the time an appeal is filed with 
the Board.  Holleman v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 929 F. App’x. 
942,  946  (Fed.  Cir.  2015)  (citing  Fernandez  v.  Dep’t  of 
Justice,  105  M.S.P.R.  443,  446  (2007)).    Ms.  Mosteller 
appealed her suspension when she first raised the issue in 
her prehearing submission on October 28, 2015, not when 
she appealed her removal on June 15, 2015.  As of October 
28, 2015, it is undisputed that the VA had already retro-
actively  paid  Ms.  Mosteller  for  the  period  of  authorized 
absence.  Therefore, the period of authorized absence was 
paid  and  does  not  fall  within  the  statutory  definition  of 
suspension.  Accordingly, the period of authorized absence 
cannot be joined with the initial fourteen-day suspension 
to create a suspension period of more than fourteen days 
for jurisdictional purposes.   

The Board correctly dismissed Ms. Mosteller’s appeal 
because she has not made a non-frivolous allegation that, 
as of October 28, 2015, she had been suspended for more 
than fourteen days.  Therefore, we affirm.
