PER CURIAM. 

   

PILLETTE v. US 

Kibbie Pillette (“Pillette”) appeals from the decision of 
the Court of Federal Claims (“the Claims Court”) on cross-
motions for judgment on the administrative record deny-
ing  Pillette’s  request  for  an  order  directing  the  Army  to 
correct his military record to reflect a medical retirement.  
See  Pillette  v.  United  States,  No.  15-353C,  2016  WL 
4059172  (Fed.  Cl.  July  29,  2016)  (“Decision”).    For  the 
following reasons, we affirm. 

BACKGROUND 

In November 1965, Pillette was shot in the jaw in Vi-
etnam.  For the next ten months, he was treated in vari-
ous  military  hospitals,  and  he  was  awarded  the  Purple 
Heart. 

On  June  7,  1966,  Pillette’s  term  of  enlisted  service 
(“ETS”) expired.  The Army retained him past that date to 
continue treating his injuries.  On July 22, 1966, Pillette 
signed an affidavit confirming his desire to be retained on 
active duty beyond his ETS (“July 1966 Affidavit”).  The 
affidavit stated, inter alia: 

I, SGT E5 KIBBIE P. PILLETTE, have been fully 
advised  by  the  undersigned  officer  of  the  ad-
vantage that may accrue to me by voluntarily re-
maining  on  active  duty  in  the  Army  beyond  the 
scheduled date of expiration of my term of service 
for the purpose of continuing medical care or hos-
pitalization and, if eligible, subsequent separation 
or retirement for physical disability under the pro-
visions  of  chapter  61,  title  10,  U.S.C.,  and  have 
been  further  advised  that  if  I  elect  instead  to  be 
discharged or released from active duty as sched-
uled  I  will  not,  after  such  discharge  or  release 
from active duty, be eligible for separation or re-
tirement for physical disability. . . .  I (do) desire

retention  on  active  duty  in  the  Army  beyond  the 
scheduled date of expiration of my tour of service.  
Supplemental Appendix (“S.A.”) 8 (emphases added).   

On  September  8,  1966, an  Army  Medical Evaluation 
Board  (“MEB”)  convened  to  determine  whether  Pillette 
was  fit  for  active  duty.    The  MEB  found  Pillette  fit  for 
duty  with  certain  limitations  based  on  a  speech  impedi-
ment.  S.A. 31–32.  The report recommended that he be 
“[r]eturned  to  duty”  and  “be  separated  from  the  service 
which  is  his  desire  since  he  is  past  his  ETS.”    Id.    The 
findings and recommendations of the MEB were approved 
on September 16, 1966.   

On September 19, 1966, Pillette acknowledged that he 
had “been informed of the approved findings and recom-
mendations  of  the  [MEB]”  and  he  crossed  out  and  ini-
tialed  the  statement  “I  do  not  agree  with  the  Board’s 
action and desire to appeal.”  Id. at 32.  Pillette did not 
appeal  the  MEB  decision.    On  September  22,  1966,  Pil-
lette  was  honorably  discharged  from  active  duty  due  to 
the expiration of his term of service and transferred to the 
active reserve.  

Immediately  following  his  discharge,  Pillette  sought 
treatment at a Veterans Affairs (“VA”) hospital.  On June 
3,  1967,  the  VA  awarded  him  a  50%  disability  rating 
effective September 23, 1966.       

In 2009, Pillette filed a request with the Army Board 
for  Correction  of  Military  Records  (“ABCMR”)  to  change 
his  discharge  from  honorable  to  a  medical  retirement 
resulting from the injuries he incurred in Vietnam.  

In  December  2009,  the  ABCMR  denied  Pillette’s  re-
quest.  The ABCMR first “determined it is in the interest 
of  justice  to  excuse  [Pillette’s]  failure  to  timely  file”  and 

 
4 

   

PILLETTE v. US 

conducted  a  substantive  review.1    In  re  Pillette,  No. 
AR20090010260,  slip  op.  at  2  (ABCMR  Dec.  29,  2009).  
The ABCMR found that the Army had properly followed 
its procedures in not issuing Pillette a medical discharge.  
Id.  at  3  (citing  Army  Regulation  (“AR”)  635-40).    The 
ABCMR found that (1) the MEB determined Pillette was 
fit for retention; (2) the MEB recommended that Pillette 
be  returned  to  duty;  and  (3)  Pillette  did  not  contest  the 
MEB’s findings.  Because the MEB found Pillette fit, he 
was not referred to a Physical Evaluation Board (“PEB”), 
and without a PEB, Pillette could not have been issued a 
medical discharge.  The ABCMR also found that Pillette 
did  not  provide  any  evidence  to  show  that  his  medical 
condition warranted consideration by a PEB. 

Pillette requested reconsideration of the ABCMR’s de-
cision three times between 2010 and 2014.  The ABCMR 
denied all of those requests. 

On  April  8,  2015,  Pillette  filed  a  complaint  in  the 
Claims  Court  challenging  the  ABCMR’s  decision.    He 
sought correction of his military record to reflect a disabil-
ity  retirement  rather  than  an  honorable  discharge  and 
back  pay  for  retirement  benefits  that  he  would  have 
received had he been given a disability retirement.   

The government moved to dismiss, or, in the alterna-
tive,  for  judgment  on  the  administrative  record.    The 
Claims  Court  denied  the  motion  to  dismiss  and  directed 
Pillette to file a cross-motion for judgment on the admin-
istrative record. 

                                            
1   Generally, applicants to the ABCMR “must file an 
application  within  three  years  after  an  alleged  error  or 
injustice  is  discovered  or  reasonably  should  have  been 
discovered.”  32 C.F.R. § 581.3(d)(2) (2016).  However, as 
the  ABCMR  did  here,  it  “may  excuse  untimely  filing  in 
the interest of justice.”  Id.    

PILLETTE v. US 

5 

On  the  cross-motions,  the  Claims  Court  granted  the 
government’s  motion  and  denied  Pillette’s  motion.    The 
court held that Pillette “ha[d] not shown that the ABCMR 
was  arbitrary  or  capricious  in  rejecting  his  claim  for  a 
disability  retirement  from  the  [A]rmy.”    Decision,  2016 
WL  4059172,  at  *3.    The  Claims  Court  agreed  with  the 
ABCMR  that  the  MEB’s  finding  of  fitness  for  retention 
made  a  PEB  unnecessary.    The  court  rejected  Pillette’s 
argument that the July 1966 Affidavit guaranteed him a 
PEB as unsupported by authority and a plain reading of 
the  document.    The  court  held  that  Pillette’s  argument 
that the Army would have reached a different conclusion 
regarding  his  fitness  for  duty  if  it  had  completed  his 
medical care was waived because it was not raised at the 
ABCMR.    The  court  also  noted  that  Pillette  had  not 
“shown  how  [this]  calls  into  question  the  MEB’s  conclu-
sion or the ABCMR’s affirmance of it.”  Id. 

The  Claims  Court  also found  that  the  MEB’s  recom-
mendations were not contradictory.  On the final page of 
the  report,  the  MEB  recommended  that  Pillette  be 
“[r]eturned  to  duty.”    S.A.  32.    But  the  report  also  “rec-
ommended  that  [Pillette]  be  separated  from  the  service 
which is his desire since he is past his ETS.”  Id. at 31.  
The court explained “[t]he recommendation in the MEB’s 
report that [Pillette] be separated from service because he 
wished  to  be  is  not  germane  to  the  question  actually 
presented to the MEB, and does not call into question its 
finding regarding his fitness for duty.”  Decision, at *3.   

Pillette timely appealed to this court.  We have juris-

diction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(3) (2012).   

DISCUSSION 

We review a Claims Court decision granting or deny-
ing  a  motion  for  judgment  on  the  administrative  record 
without deference, applying the same standard of review 
that the Claims Court applied.  Roth v. United States, 378 
F.3d 1371, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2004).  We will not disturb the 

 
6 

   

PILLETTE v. US 

ABCMR’s  decision  unless  “the  decision  is  arbitrary  or 
capricious,  unsupported  by  substantial  evidence,  or  oth-
erwise  not  in  accordance  with  law.”    Fisher  v.  United 
States, 402 F.3d 1167, 1180 (Fed. Cir. 2005).  Generally, 
arguments not raised before the ABCMR are waived.  See 
Metz v. United States, 466 F.3d 991, 999 (Fed. Cir. 2006).     
The  Secretary  of  the  Army,  acting  through  the 
ABCMR,  “may  correct  any  military  record  . . .  when  the 
Secretary  considers  it  necessary  to  correct  an  error  or 
remove  an  injustice.”    10  U.S.C.  §  1552(a)(1).    “The 
ABCMR  begins  its  consideration  of  each  case  with  the 
presumption  of  administrative  regularity.”    AR  15-185 
¶ 2–9 (Mar. 31, 2006).  To overcome this presumption, the 
“applicant has the burden of proving an error or injustice 
by a preponderance of the evidence.”  Id. 

A  member  of  the  Army  may  be  retired  with  retired 
pay  if  the  member  “is  unfit  to  perform  the  duties  of  his 
office, grade, rank, or rating because of physical disability 
incurred  while  entitled  to  basic  pay”  under  certain  cir-
cumstances.  10 U.S.C. § 1201 (1964).  AR 635-40 imple-
ments  provisions  of  Title  10  relating  to  eligibility  and 
processing  for  physical  disability  benefits.    AR  635-40A 
§ 1  ¶  1  (Aug.  13, 1957); AR  635-40  ¶ 1–1 (Feb.  8,  2006).  
The “Army regulations in effect at the time of [Pillette’s] 
discharge  in  [1966],  rather  than  current  regulations, 
guide our analysis.”  Chambers, 417 F.3d at 1227.   

Pillette argues that the Claims Court erred in denying 
his  motion  for  judgment  on  the  administrative  record.  
Pillette asserts that various provisions of AR 635-200 and 
the  July  1966  Affidavit  demonstrate  that  his  medical 
condition warranted the completion of his medical treat-
ment  prior  to  his  discharge  and  evaluation  by  a  PEB.  
Pillette contends that the July 1966 Affidavit guaranteed 
him  a  PEB.    Pillette  also  contends  that  an  MEB  should 
not have been convened and that AR 635-40 did not apply 
to  him  when  the  MEB  convened  because  the  Army  had 

PILLETTE v. US 

7 

retained him past his June 7, 1966 ETS.  Pillette further 
asserts that his retention in the army for 45 days past his 
scheduled  ETS  without  his  prior  consent  violated  his 
rights under AR 635-200.2   

The government responds that the Claims Court did 
not  commit  reversible  error.    The  government  contends 
that the ABCMR’s decision was not arbitrary, capricious, 
unsupported by substantial evidence, or contrary to law. 

We agree with the government that the Claims Court 
did  not  err.    The  ABCMR’s  determination  that  Pillette 
received  proper  processing  under  AR  635-40  was  not 
arbitrary  and  capricious  or  unsupported  by  substantial 
evidence.  When Pillette’s case was referred to the MEB, 
it was charged with evaluating his condition and recom-
mending an appropriate disposition.  See AR 635-40A § III 
¶ 10 (Aug. 13, 1957).  Because the MEB found him fit for 
duty,  referral  to  a  PEB  was  not  required.    Indeed,  only 
“[w]hen the approved action of the [MEB] d[id] not provide 
for either final medical disposition of the case (e.g., return 
to duty . . . ) or deferment of disposition pending transfer 
or further observation, [was] the case . . .  referred to the 
jurisdiction  of  a  [PEB]  for  disposition.”    Id.  (emphasis 
added);  see  also  id.  §  IV  ¶  19  (stating  cases  of  members 
who appeared to be “medically unfit for active duty” were 
“referred  to  a  [PEB]  for  disposition”).    The  MEB  recom-
mended that Pillette be returned to duty, a final medical 
disposition from which Pillette did not appeal.  The Army 
thus followed proper procedure in not referring Pillette to 
a PEB. 

                                            
2   Pillette appears to cite currently effective AR 635-
200.  Our analysis, however, is based on the regulation in 
effect at the time of Pillette’s ETS and discharge in 1966.  
See Chambers, 417 F.3d at 1227.

PILLETTE v. US 

Although  we  question  whether  the  ABCMR  properly 
applied  the  version  of  AR  635-40  that  was  in  effect  in 
1966,3  to  the  extent  the  ABCMR  incorrectly  applied  the 
current AR 635-40, any such error was harmless.  Under 
both  the  Army  regulations  in  effect  now  and  those  in 
effect  in  1966,  the  procedure  for  evaluating  a  soldier’s 
medical  fitness  for  duty  and  eligibility  for  a  disability 
retirement is substantially the same in relevant part.  An 
MEB  must  first  find  a  soldier  medically  unfit  before 
referral to a PEB.  AR 635-40A § III ¶ 10, § IV ¶ 19 (Aug. 
13, 1957); AR 635-40 ¶¶ 4–10, 4–13 (Feb. 8, 2006).  Upon 
referral, a PEB makes disability findings and recommen-
dations  that  can  lead  to  a  medical  retirement.    See  AR 
635-40A § IV ¶ 28 (Aug. 13, 1957); AR 635-40 ¶ 4–19 (Feb. 
8, 2006). 

Additionally, we can discern no error in the ABCMR’s 
finding of a lack of evidence that Pillette’s medical condi-
tion warranted consideration by a PEB.  Compliance with 
AR 635-200 did not require Pillette to be evaluated by a 
PEB.  See AR 635-200 § IV ¶ 14(d) (Apr. 8, 1959) (explain-
ing that a member “may, with his consent, be retained in 
service  beyond  the  expiration  of  his  period  of  service  in 
order that he may complete the required medical care or 
hospitalization  and,  if  required,  be  brought  before  a 
[PEB]”  (emphasis  added)  (citing  AR  635-40A));  AR  635-
200 ¶ 2–6 (July 15, 1966) (same).  As contemplated by AR 
635-200,  the  Army  retained  Pillette  past  his  scheduled 
ETS to continue providing him with medical care and had 
him sign the July 1966 Affidavit consenting to his reten-
tion.  See AR 635-200 § IV ¶ 14(d) (Apr. 8, 1959); AR 635-
200 ¶  2–6  (July  15, 1966).    Although  Pillette  signed  the 

                                            
3   Compare Pillette, No. AR20090010260, slip op. at 
3, with AR 635-40 ¶¶ 4–9, 4–10 (Feb. 8, 2006); compare In 
re  Pillette,  No.  AR20100009820,  slip  op.  at  3  (ABCMR 
Sept. 21, 2010), with AR 635-40 ¶ 3–2(b)(1) (Feb. 8, 2006). 

PILLETTE v. US 

9 

July  1966  Affidavit  45  days  after  his  scheduled  ETS, 
there was no harm to Pillette’s eligibility for a disability 
retirement as a result of this delay.  See AR 635-200 § IV 
¶ 14(d) (Apr. 8, 1959); AR 635-200 ¶ 2–6 (July 15, 1966).   
We also do not agree with Pillette’s contentions that 
the  MEB  was  improperly  convened  and  that  AR  635-40 
did  not  apply  to  him  when  it  was  convened.    Pillette 
consented to his retention on active duty past his sched-
uled  ETS  “for  the  purpose  of  continuing  medical  care  or 
hospitalization  and,  if  eligible,  subsequent  separation  or 
retirement  for  physical  disability.”    S.A.  8.    AR  635-40 
implemented Title 10 eligibility and processing for physi-
cal  disability  benefits and  specified  that members  of  the 
Regular  Army,  like  Pillette,  “will  be  processed  under 
these regulations” except in situations inapplicable here.  
AR 635-40A § 1 ¶¶ 1, 2 (Aug. 13, 1957).  Thus, AR 635-40 
applied  to  Pillette  when  the  MEB  was  convened  and  he 
has shown no impropriety by the MEB.   

Furthermore,  we  do  not  agree  with  Pillette  that  the 
July 1966 Affidavit guaranteed him a PEB.  This affidavit 
appears to be a form affidavit used by the Army to con-
firm a service member’s intent to remain in the service or 
be discharged.  Compare S.A. 8, with AR 635-200 § IV ¶ 
14(d)(5)  (Apr.  8,  1959)  and  AR  635-200  ¶  2–6  (July  15, 
1966).    The  July  1966  Affidavit  made  clear  that  Pillette 
would  be  considered  for  “retirement  for  physical  disabil-
ity” “if eligible.”  S.A. 8 (emphasis added).  The affidavit 
did not mention a PEB, or indicate that it superseded the 
provisions  of  AR  635-40.    As  discussed  above,  we  can 
discern  no  error  in  the  ABCMR’s  finding  that  the  Army 
properly processed Pillette under AR 635-40.  Nothing in 
the  affidavit  or  any  authority  of  which  we  are  aware 
supports  Pillette’s  position  that  the  affidavit  guaranteed 
him a PEB. 

Finally,  we  find  no  reversible  error  in  the  Claims 
Court’s holding that Pillette waived his argument regard-

 
10 

   

PILLETTE v. US 

ing  the  Army’s  alleged  failure  to  complete  his  medical 
care prior to his discharge.  Pillette does not contest the 
waiver holding before this court, and the ABCMR did not 
pass  on  this  issue.    In  any  event,  as  the  Claims  Court 
noted, Pillette “has not shown how [this] calls into ques-
tion the MEB’s conclusion or the ABCMR’s affirmance of 
it.”  Decision, 2016 WL 4059172, at *3. 

In sum, Pillette has not shown that the ABCMR erred 
in holding that he had not established any error or injus-
tice in his military record.  Pillette is therefore not enti-
tled to correction of his military record.     

CONCLUSION 

We  have  considered  Pillette’s  remaining  arguments 
and conclude that they are without merit.  For the forego-
ing reason, the decision of the Claims Court is affirmed.
