PER CURIAM. 

  JOHNSON v. US 

Antonio Johnson appeals the judgment of the Court of 
Federal Claims dismissing his claim that he was wrong-
fully  discharged  from  the  United  States  Army  and  up-
holding  a  decision  by  the  Army  Board  for  Correction  of 
Military  Records  (“ABCMR”)  not  to  convert  Johnson’s 
involuntary  discharge  for  disciplinary  reasons  into  a 
disability retirement. We affirm. 

BACKGROUND 

Johnson’s military service began with his enlistment 
in the Army on January 29, 1980. He received an involun-
tary  administrative  “general  discharge  under  honorable 
conditions” on December 13, 1988. In the two years lead-
ing  up  to  his  discharge,  Johnson  was  disciplined  for 
various instances of misconduct, including a conviction for 
driving  under  the  influence,  nonpayment  of  debts  and 
court judgments, and for being absent without leave.  

In connection with his discharge, Johnson received a 
comprehensive  medical  evaluation  on  April  21,  1988. 
Records  from  this  evaluation  indicated  that  Johnson 
complained  of  a  “[r]ecent  gain  or  loss  of  weight”  and 
“[r]ecurrent back pain,” but that he suffered from no other 
ailments  besides  those  he  had  identified.  Appx225–26. 
Handwritten annotations also reflected that Johnson was 
hospitalized in 1984 following a motor vehicle accident in 
which he injured his back.  Clinical evaluations of John-
son concluded that he was physically qualified for separa-
tion  and  that  he  had  the  mental  capacity  to  understand 
and participate in his discharge proceedings. Four weeks 
after  being  medically  evaluated  for  military  discharge, 
Johnson  was  hospitalized  for  eighteen  days  due  to  chest 
pain and given a diagnosis of pleurodynia secondary to a 
viral  infection.  He  left  the  hospital  on  June  6,  1988, 
“markedly improved,” with instructions that he be given 
limited duty for one week. Appx163. 

JOHNSON v. US 

3 

In  2013,  Johnson  filed  an  application  with  the 
ABCMR,  asserting  that  he  was  entitled  to  a  medical 
disability discharge retirement in 1988. He requested that 
his  military  discipline  records  be  expunged,  his  general 
discharge voided, and that he be awarded medical disabil-
ity  retirement.  The  ABCMR  denied  his  application  on 
October 15, 2014.  

Johnson then filed a complaint in the Court of Federal 
Claims  alleging  that  he  had  been  wrongfully  discharged 
from  the  Army  and  that  he  was  entitled  to  “physical 
disability retirement with pay.” Appx7. The court granted 
the  government’s  motion  to  dismiss  Johnson’s  wrongful 
military discharge claim as jurisdictionally barred by the 
six-year limitations period of 28 U.S.C. § 2501. The court 
also granted the government’s motion for judgment on the 
administrative record with respect to Johnson’s disability 
retirement  claim,  finding  that  the  ABCMR’s  denial  of 
Johnson’s  application  was  neither  arbitrary,  capricious, 
nor  unsupported  by  substantial  evidence.  Johnson  ap-
pealed. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(3). 

DISCUSSION 

We review a dismissal for lack of subject matter juris-
diction de novo. See Shoshone Indian Tribe of Wind River 
Reservation,  Wyo.  v.  United  States,  672  F.3d  1021,  1029 
(Fed.  Cir.  2012).  “We  review  a  decision  of  the  Court  of 
Federal  Claims  granting  or  denying  a  motion  for  judg-
ment on the administrative record without deference . . . 
[and] will not disturb the decision of the [ABCMR] unless 
it is arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, or unsupported 
by substantial evidence.” Chambers v. United States, 417 
F.3d 1218, 1227 (Fed. Cir. 2005).  

Our  cases  make  clear  that  a  claim  for  wrongful  dis-
charge  accrues  at  the  time  the  discharge  occurred.  See 
Martinez v. United States, 333 F.3d 1295, 1303 (Fed. Cir. 
2003) (en banc). Johnson’s wrongful discharge claim was 
filed in the Court of Federal Claims more than two dec-

  JOHNSON v. US 

ades after his discharge from the Army in 1988. His claim 
is therefore barred by the six-year statute of limitations of 
28 U.S.C. § 2501. 

As for Johnson’s claim of entitlement to military disa-
bility  retirement  benefits,  we  perceive  no  error  in  either 
the analysis of the Court of Federal Claims or that of the 
ABCMR.  In  order  to  establish  entitlement  to  disability 
retirement, Johnson was required to show that his service 
was  “interrupted  . . .  because  of  a  physical  disability 
incurred or aggravated in service” and that he could “no 
longer  continue  to  reasonably  perform”  his  duties.  Army 
Reg.  635–40  ¶  3–2(b)(1)  (Mar.  8,  2006).1  In  finding  that 
Johnson  did  not  satisfy  this  standard,  the  ABCMR  con-
sidered Johnson’s medical records, including the medical 
evaluation  of  Johnson  taken  as  part  of  his  discharge 
proceedings, which had found him “medically qualified for 
separation.”  Appx113.  The  ABCMR  accepted  this  as 
evidence that Johnson was “medically and psychiatrically 
fit  for  military  service”  at  the  time  of  his  discharge.  Id. 
The  record  of  Johnson’s  hospitalization  for  chest  pain 
shortly  after  his  evaluation  does  not  yield  a  different 
conclusion,  and  Johnson  identifies  no  other  record  that 
would. To the extent that Johnson alleges on appeal that 
military personnel misled him or fabricated records, that 
his  records  are  inaccurate,  or  that  his  discharge  was 
procedurally flawed, he identifies no evidence that would 

                                            
1   See also Army Reg. 635–40 ¶ 2–1 (Dec. 13, 1985) 
(“The mere presence of an impairment does not, of itself, 
justify a finding of unfitness because of  physical disabil-
ity.  In  each  case,  it  is  necessary  to  compare  the  nature 
and  degree  of  physical  disability  present  with  the  re-
quirements of the duties the member reasonably may be 
expected  to  perform  because  of  his  or  her  office,  grade, 
rank, or rating . . . .”).
