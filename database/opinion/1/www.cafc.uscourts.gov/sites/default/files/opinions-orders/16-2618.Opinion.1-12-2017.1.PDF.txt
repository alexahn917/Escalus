  JOHNSON v. US 

PER CURIAM. 
 
Anthony Johnson appeals the judgment of the United 
States Court of Federal Claims dismissing his complaint 
for  lack  of  subject  matter  jurisdiction.    Johnson  also 
appeals the Court of Federal Claims’ denial of his motion 
to  amend  his  complaint  as  futile  because  the  additional 
asserted  claim  was  also  beyond  the  court’s  jurisdiction.  
We affirm. 

BACKGROUND 

 
Between January and October of 2015, Johnson filed 
three civil suits in the United States District Court for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  In these cases, Johnson 
alleged  that  various  state  and  federal  judges  had  con-
spired  to  rule  against  him  in  the  past  due  to  his  race.  
Each  of  these  cases  was  dismissed  by  the  district  court 
judge  for  failure  to  state  a  claim.    In  response  to  these 
dismissals,  on  December  14,  2015,  Johnson  filed  a  com-
plaint  in  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims,  pursuant  to  the 
Federal  Tort  Claims  Act  (“FTCA”),  28  U.S.C.  § 1346(b), 
alleging  that these  dismissals  constituted  a  tort  because 
they exhibited a systematic pattern of summarily dismiss-
ing  civil  rights  cases  filed  by  African  Americans.    The 
complaint  names  U.S.  District  Court  Judges  Alejandro, 
O’Neill,  and  Rufe,  U.S.  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Third 
Circuit Clerk of Court Waldron, and the United States, as 
defendants. 
 
In  the  complaint,  Johnson  alleged  two  causes  of 
action.    First,  Johnson  alleged  that  the  defendants  en-
gaged  in  a  tort  by  “manipulat[ing]  .  .  .  procedural  due 
processes . . . governing the summary dismissal protocols 
[] 
the 
gu[a]ranteed  right  to  a  jury  trial  of  African  Americans 
suing white federal officers of the Court.”  JA 8.  Second, 
Johnson alleged that the defendants engaged in a tort by 
“secretly  misusing”  taxpayer  monies  “for  the  purpose  of 

the  unlawful  purpose  of  eliminating 

[f]or

3 

sabotaging the right to a jury trial.”  JA 9.  According to 
Johnson, this misuse also amounted to a breach of fiduci-
ary  duty  by  the  United  States  as  a  trustee  of  taxpayer 
funds. 
  On February 26, 2016, Johnson moved to amend his 
complaint by supplementing, as an additional allegation, 
the  fact  that  Judge  O’Neill  issued  an  order  requiring 
Johnson to show cause on why an injunction should not be 
issued  to  prevent  him  from  filing  additional  lawsuits 
raising  the  same  subjects  as  the  cases  that  had  already 
been dismissed by the district court in 2015. 
 
The  Court  of  Federal  Claims  dismissed  Johnson’s 
complaint.  First, the court noted that “claims made under 
the  Federal  Tort  Claims  Act  are  outside  of  our  court’s 
subject-matter jurisdiction.”  JA 16.  Second, with respect 
to  the  misuse  of  taxpayer  funds,  the  court  noted  that 
Johnson  failed  to  specify  how  the  funds  were  misused.  
Finally,  with  respect  to  Johnson’s  motion  to  amend  his 
complaint, the court denied the motion as futile because 
reviewing the actions of a federal district court is beyond 
the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. 
 
U.S.C. § 1295(a)(3). 

Johnson  appeals.    We  have  jurisdiction  under  28 

DISCUSSION 

  We review de novo a decision by the Court of Federal 
Claims  to  dismiss  for  lack  of  jurisdiction.    Radioshack 
Corp.  v.  United  States,  566  F.3d  1358,  1360  (Fed.  Cir. 
2009).  

Even  apart  from  the  impropriety  of  bringing  a  tort 
claim against the government for actions of federal judges 
in  their  decision-making  capacities,  it  is  clear  that  the 
Court  of  Federal  Claims  lacks  jurisdiction  over  claims 
against the government under the FTCA.  See 28 U.S.C. 
§ 1491(a)(1).    “The  plain  language  of  the  Tucker  Act 

4 

 

  JOHNSON v. US 

[which  created  Court  of  Federal  Claims  jurisdiction] 
excludes  from  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims  jurisdiction 
claims sounding in tort.”  Rick’s Mushroom Serv., Inc. v. 
United  States,  521  F.3d  1338,  1343  (Fed.  Cir.  2008).  
Therefore,  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims  correctly  dis-
missed Johnson’s tort claims for lack of jurisdiction. 
  On  appeal,  Johnson  argues  that  the  United  States 
breached  its  fiduciary  duty  by  misusing  taxpayer  funds.  
Taxpayers lack standing to sue for alleged misuse of tax 
funds.  Ariz. Christian Sch. Tuition Org. v. Winn, 563 U.S. 
125, 134–36 (2011). 

Finally,  with  respect  to  Johnson’s  motion  to  amend 
his  complaint  to  supplement  allegations  concerning  a 
district  court  injunction,  we  agree  that  “the  Court  of 
Federal  Claims  does  not  have  jurisdiction  to  review  the 
decisions of district courts.”  Joshua v. United States, 17 
F.3d 378, 380 (Fed. Cir. 1994).
